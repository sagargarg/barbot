BarBot was created by Shreyas Hirday, Sagar Garg, Shaantam Chawla, and Nishanth Shanmugham at PennApps XI on January 16-18, 2015.

BarBot utilizes a combination of Android and Arduino to store your temptations and keep you from simply taking 
TOO MUCH. It first started off as an idea for a robot that could move around and carry drinks for people at a party. 
Each person gets a limited numbers of drinks, and once that limit is reached, BarBot doesn't let you take anymore. 
We later expanded this idea to eating healthy as well. 

One key feature is that BarBot can automatically lift its cover so you can take what you went. This is done using 
sonar data. Another key feature is that the Android app keeps track of how much you have had. The best part is that 
guests can use BarBot without having to register!
